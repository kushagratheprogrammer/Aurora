# not begin only short description of options available will be shown
#
# -unsafe option set the judgement for all languages 
# (some which can used to perform suspicious operations)
#
# -cache option tells the judge to cache input and correct output first
# time the solution for a problem is submitted and later use this cache
# rather than fetching data from database each time.
#

# Exit chroot by simply using 'exit'.

**Note :** 
* To bring judge to foreground use 'fg (jobnumber)'. 
* To enquire about the job number use 'jobs'.
* To shutdown judge simply bring it to foreground and send keyboard interupt i.e, CTRL+C
